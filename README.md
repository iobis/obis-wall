**PROJECT NAME**  
Development of Information Products and Services to support global assessments  
[Long title] Development of Information Products and Services based on OBIS and HAEDAT to support the WOA, IPBES and a Global HAB Status Report (DIPS-4-Ocean Assessments)

**MAIN PROJECT OBJECTIVE**  
This project aims to develop biodiversity information to support global assessments on the state of the marine environment, as well as publish an IOC-UNESCO Global Harmful Algal Bloom Status Report on the distribution and impact of harmful algae. This project makes use of data from the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS), the Harmful Algal Event Database (HAEDAT) and the IOC-UNESCO Taxonomic Reference List of Harmful Micro Algae.

**GEOGRAPHICAL SCOPE (COUNTRIES/INSTITUTIONS SHOWN ON MAP)**  
Global. See sankey diagram.

**WHAT IS/WILL BE THE RESULT OF THE PROJECT?**  
OBIS aims to build a technologically "smart" clearing house, providing a user-friendly interface to a trustworthy source of marine biodiversity research data and information, and one that can pursue innovative applications powered by the system.
